                    <h2>Simple Way To Start Eating Healthier</h2>
                    <p>Keep healthy food readily available. When you get hungry, you’re more likely to eat the first thing you see on the counter or in the cupboard. Keep healthy food in easily accessible and visible places in your home and workplace.  Put some fruits in a basket and place it on the kitchen counter.</p>

Hinoki timber is highly revered in much of traditional Japanese architecture. At Shinji by Restaurant, it sets the stage for Master Chef and his team to demonstrate an artistry that dates back thousands of years.</p>

Some people call them "nature's fast food" because they are so easy to carry and prepare. However, fruits are relatively high in sugar compared to other whole foods. </p>
